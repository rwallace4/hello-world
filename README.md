Hello World Test Repository

Hello! My name is Rose Wallace and I'm a student at Wake Tech Community College! I have one semester left of an internship before I graduate. I'm excited to be almost finished with school and be off on my new adventure! I have loved my time at Wake Tech and have been so grateful for the kind and wonderful professors who have been so helpful to me along the way!
